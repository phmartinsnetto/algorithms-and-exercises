A coding exercise assigned to me in an internship selection process.

The goal was to build a function that receives a string like "Hello apple pie"
and then returns the word in which there are the highest number of same letter
repetitions. If there are more than one word with the same number of repetitions,
the function should return the first word. And if there is no word with a letter repetition,
the function should return -1.

So, the input "Hello apple pie" should imply in the output "Hello",
and the input "No word in this" should get back the output "-1".
