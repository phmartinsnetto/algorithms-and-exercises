A coding exercise assigned to me in an internship selection process.

In this exercise the goal was to build a function that received an array
of strings, like ["X:-1", "Y:1", "X:-4", "B:3", "X:5"] and then returns
a string that informs the global sum of each "key" and excludes keys in which
the sum was 0. The output should also order the keys in alphabetical order.

So, for the input ["X:-1", "Y:1", "X:-4", "B:3", "X:5"] we should expect "B:3,Y:1" as output.
